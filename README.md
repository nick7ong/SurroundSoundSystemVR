# Digital Twin of a 5.1 Surround Sound System in VR

A virtual reality application built with Unity and XR Interaction Toolkit that simulates a 5.1 surround sound system using spatialized audio stems. Designed for immersive music listening, this project allows users to interactively position and mix channel stems (left, right, center, LFE/subwoofer, left surround, right surround) in 3D space.

All 5.1 versions of the audio mixes were upmixed from stereo using [UpmixAI](https://github.com/nick7ong/UpmixAI-Demo), a deep neural network-based upmixing system developed as part of my master's research on automatic stereo-to-surround conversion. The original stereo audio content was obtained using [YTAudioScraper](https://github.com/nick7ong/YTAudioScraper), a YouTube audio extraction tool I built for research and educational use.

## Songs:
- Sound & Color - Alabama Shakes
- Jigsaw Falling into Place - Radiohead
- Bohemian Rhapsody - Queen
